echo "a :- &k{b}. {b}." | eclingo --semantics c19-1 --reification 0

Should it not also generate u(b) on the model for atom u(b) coming from the positive candidate k(u(b)).
And form a world view &m{b}, because it is false that b is false for all stable models, therefore is true for some?

The same way that "a :- &k{not b}. {b}.



- Project parameter:

    Test1: echo "b :- &k{ not a }. c :- &k{ b }. {a}." | eclingo --semantics c19-1 --reification

    World view is &m{a}
    Gets repeated if not configured project="auto,3"

    Write tests that avoid this kind of behavior

    Test2: echo "a :- &k{not b}. {b}." | eclingo --semantics c19-1 --reification 0
